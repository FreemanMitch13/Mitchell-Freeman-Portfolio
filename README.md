# Mitchell-Freeman-Portfolio

## Goals
    The goal of this homework assignment was to create a portfolio page that I can begin to store my work in.
    
### Requirments
    This project requires the creation of a portfolio page from scratch. The portfolio page must be responsive with sections for an about me, my work, and my contact information with a navigation bar that allows the user to navigate to the desired section. There is a size requirment in the section for "my work" that states that the image displaying my first project be larger than the others.
    
### Technologies
    For this project I used HTML and CSS to create my Portfolio Page
